                    When he was around zero years old, John Avon realized that the only thing he was ever 'really' good
                    at was Art. As a school kid he began painting many surrealistic images, including a house being
                    filled with toothpaste and a submarine being attacked by a shrimp... a pattern was emerging!</p>

                <p>Having mastered classical oil painting as a teenager, John furthered his education on graphic design
                    degree in Britain’s most bohemian city, Brighton.</p>

                <p>On graduating John embarked upon his by career painting book covers for some of the world’s most
                    famous authors including Stephen King, Arthur C Clarke, Peter James, Harry Harrison and Terry
                    Pratchett. After about 5 years he moved over to acrylics and airbrushing, so his art would arrive at
                    the publishers actually dry! By chance in 1996 John met one of the art directors for Magic: the
                    Gathering and that was the start of a long and beautiful relationship. John’s first painting for
                    Magic was Purple Mountain.</p>

                <p>John lives in Brighton with his wife Patricia and two teenage sons.</p>

                <p>John Avon Art is a partnership between John Avon and his friend Guy Coulson. Guy is a lifetime
                    science fiction fan and has a passion for fantasy artwork.</p>
