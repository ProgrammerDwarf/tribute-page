                    <p>
                        When he was around zero years old, John Avon realized that the only thing he was ever 'really'
                        good
                        at was Art. As a school kid he began painting many surrealistic images, including a house being
                        filled with toothpaste and a submarine being attacked by a shrimp... a pattern was
                        emerging!<br><br>

                        Having mastered classical oil painting as a teenager, John furthered his education on graphic
                        design
                        degree in Britain’s most bohemian city, Brighton.<br><br>

                        On graduating John embarked upon his by career painting book covers for some of the world’s most
                        famous authors including Stephen King, Arthur C Clarke, Peter James, Harry Harrison and Terry
                        Pratchett. After about 5 years he moved over to acrylics and airbrushing, so his art would
                        arrive at
                        the publishers actually dry! By chance in 1996 John met one of the art directors for Magic: the
                        Gathering and that was the start of a long and beautiful relationship. John’s first painting for
                        Magic was Purple Mountain.<br><br>

                        John lives in Brighton with his wife Patricia and two teenage sons.<br><br>

                        John Avon Art is a partnership between John Avon and his friend Guy Coulson. Guy is a lifetime
                        science fiction fan and has a passion for fantasy artwork.
